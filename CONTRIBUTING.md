# Contributing to CreatorsHub

Thanks for wanting to contribute.  
CreatorsHub.Global is built on clarity, ownership, and simplicity.  

## Pull Requests
- Always create a branch from `main`.
- Keep PRs small, focused, and well-named (`fix/...`, `feature/...`, `chore/...`).
- All code is reviewed by the owner (@jmcdmex) before merging.
- Merges happen only through Pull Requests — never push to `main`.

## Style & Standards
- Follow existing code style and naming patterns.
- Keep code clean, commented only where necessary.
- No unnecessary dependencies or abstractions.

## Communication
- Keep discussion factual and result-oriented.
- If something breaks, fix it — don’t explain it away.
